A classic Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer opponent with score tracking across rounds. Includes 5 switchable visual themes.
Part of the Code Odysseys series - JavaScript fundamentals practice.

### Demo :- [Live Now]()

## Concepts Covered
- `Math.random()` combined with `Math.floor()` to simulate computer "AI" choice
- Object literal as a rule lookup table (`WIN_RULES`) instead of nested if/else chains
- Function decomposition: `getComputerChoice`, `determineWinner`, `playRound`, `updateScoreboard`
- Data attributes (`data-choice`) to drive logic from button clicks
- String manipulation (`charAt`, `toUpperCase`, `slice`) for capitalizing text
- Persistent state (scores) across multiple rounds until explicitly reset

## Features
- Rock / Paper / Scissors buttons with emoji icons
- Randomized computer choice each round
- Win/lose/tie logic driven by a compact rule object rather than repeated conditionals
- Live scoreboard: player wins, computer wins, ties
- Reset button to clear all scores and start fresh
- 5 selectable styles: Classic, Minimal, Dark, Gradient, Neon
